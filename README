This is a Subversion plugin for History Flow, which can be found at:

  http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/historyflow
  http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/visual/projects/history_flow/

The plugin allows you to use History Flow to view the history of a file
in a Subversion repository. svn:// and http:// repositories are
supported.

To build the plugin a few thirdparty libraries are required. They are
included with this project:

 * SVNKit 1.3.4
 * SwiXml 1.5 build 149
 * JDOM (from the SwiXml download)
 * History Flow

The project should build using Eclipse. To deploy the plugin, copy
build.properties.default to build.properties and set the value of
historyflow.dir. Then run:

  $ ant deploy-plugin-jar

For convenience, you can then run History Flow with:

  $ ant run-historyflow
